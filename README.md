# IOS-Burstcoin-miner-wallet-plotter


Hey guys. I am an IOS/Android developer and teacher. I have started to develop a solution for Iphones and Ipads; mobile operating systems are the future and we should be ahead of other coins. Burstâ€™s efficiency fits perfectly for mobile devices. The initial release will have a passphrase save and load function plus faucet and there will be plotting and mining available so everybody in the world can be part of the network - mining Burst and use it. Burst mining favors by design small miners and keeps the networks truly decentralized. To release the first version quickly and get mining and plotting I have asked my compsci students to join and help me out - and for THEM is this Crowdfund. - and we get them on board for further projects! Thank you for your support.


If you would like to donate please use our crowdfund in the wallet or send burstcoin to BURST-EUT6-YC9L-N63Y-2XH6S

Thank you
